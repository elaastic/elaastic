<h1>INFORMATION NOTICE AND INFORMED CONSENT</h1>
<h4>Last updated: <span th:text="${#dates.format(startDate, 'dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm')}">dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm</span></h4>
<p>
    You are invited to participate in a study conducted and supervised by Franck Silvestre (study leader),
    a researcher at the Institute of Research in Computer Science of Toulouse, Joint Research Unit No. 5505 of the CNRS,
    UT3, UT2J, UT1, and INPT.
</p>
<p>
    This document describes the study you are being asked to participate in and answers questions you
    may have based on the currently available information.
</p>
<p>
    Before deciding whether or not to participate, it is important that you understand the purpose of this study and
    what it involves.
</p>
<h2>1) Why are you being asked to participate in this study?</h2>
<p>
    This study is being offered to you because you are a teacher or student in a primary, secondary, or higher education institution.
</p>
<h2>2) What are the objectives of the study?</h2>
<p>
    Within the Talent team of IRIT, a group of people under the responsibility of Franck Silvestre is working
    on the design and development of digital systems to support active pedagogies.
    This research program is called Elaastic and has led to the design of the Web platform of the same name.
    The researchers of the Elaastic program make the "elaastic" web platform available to teachers and students of the Nancy-Metz academy,
    the Occitanie Academy, and more generally to any voluntary primary, secondary, or higher education teacher, to orchestrate educational sequences in order
    to collect and analyze the traces resulting from users' interactions with elaastic. This collection and
    the associated analysis aim to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>better understand and characterize what constitutes a "good" formative assessment sequence orchestrated by a digital platform;</li>
    <li>propose guidelines for the design of digital platforms dedicated to the orchestration of formative assessment sequences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) What are the expected benefits of your participation in the study?</h2>
<p>
    The expected benefits of this research are to provide knowledge on the proper implementation of formative
    assessment sequences supported by technology in or out of the classroom to improve teaching and
    learning in a school context.
</p>

<h2>4) Does your participation in the study involve any particular risks and/or constraints?</h2>

To our knowledge, this research does not involve any risk or discomfort other than those of daily life.

<h2>5) How will the study be conducted?</h2>
<p>
    You are a teacher<br/>
    If you agree to participate in this study, you will be invited to create questions and assignments on the
    elaastic platform to question your students during classes or in the context of homework.
    You can then use elaastic to manage the different phases of your formative assessments
    (question answering phase, viewpoint confrontation phase, feedback phase).
</p>
<p>
    You are a student<br/>
    If you agree to participate in this study, you will be invited to answer the questions posed by your
    teachers using the elaastic platform and to give your opinion on the answers of your classmates.
    Your contributions to an assignment will be used by your teacher to provide you with
    feedback to improve your understanding of the topics covered in the questions.
</p>

<h2>6) What are your rights as a research participant?</h2>
<p>
    You are completely free to accept or refuse to participate in this study without having to justify yourself,
    and without any consequences for you.
</p>
<p>
    You have as much time as you need to make your decision.

    by simply sending an email to franck.silvestre@irit.fr.
</p>

<h2>7) Does this study involve the processing of your personal data?</h2>
<p>
    Your participation involves the processing of personal data based on the information
    that concerns you and that will be produced as part of this study.
</p>
<p>
    This processing is for scientific research purposes and is based on the performance of a task
    carried out in the public interest (art. 6.1.e of the General Data Protection Regulation) as well as your consent.
</p>
<p>
    The data controller is the Institute of Research in Computer Science of Toulouse (UMR 5505).
</p>

<h2>8) What are your rights regarding your personal data?</h2>

    You can access your data or request its deletion. You also have the right
    to object, the right to rectification, and the right to restrict the processing of your data.
    These rights cannot be exercised if they are likely to make it impossible or seriously compromise
    the achievement of the research objectives.
</p>

<h2>9) How is your personal data managed?</h2>

<p>
    As part of this study, the following information is collected and analyzed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identification data: name – first name – email address</li>
    <li>Professional life data: School, class, groups, questions posed by teachers, students' answers, students' results in formative assessments.</li>
    <li>Connection data: IP address, browser, HTTP requests, HTTP response code.</li>

<p>
    This data is processed by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The study leader</li>
    <li>Members of the TALENT research team participating in the research program</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Data transfer outside the European Economic Area: <strong>NO</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To ensure the security and confidentiality of your data, the following measures are in place:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data collection and access to personal data are limited to the exclusive use of the Elaastic research team, within the specified purposes;</li>
    <li>None of the personal data collected by the research team can be published or made public in such a way that participants can be identified;</li>
    <li>Participants' personal data will be pseudonymized, at most 3 years after the end of data collection by the research team;</li>
    <li>Data access rights will be:
        <ul>
            <li>limited and only accessible to the research team.</li>
            <li>secured by a personal identifier and password.</li>
            <li>Research data is encrypted from the time of data collection and throughout the project, until its final pseudonymization.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Only data that does not allow you to be identified will be published in the form of a thesis manuscript
    and/or an article in a scientific journal, to improve research knowledge.
    The research results may also be presented at professional and scientific conferences.
</p>
<p>
    Directly identifiable data (correspondence tables) will be kept by the study leader for up to three years after the last publication from the research project.
    The data will then be anonymized (deletion of the correspondence table, etc.) and archived.
</p>
