During phase 1, each learner must answer the question that you asked by...
1. ...selecting the correct answer(s)
2. ...providing a written explanation (if you chose this option during the sequence configuration)
3. ...providing her confidence degree ranging from "Not confident at all" to "Totally confident"

When all you learners answered the question, click on "End phase 1". If you chose "Hybrid" or "Distance" as you execution contect, phase 2 will automatically follow for each learner without any need for you to intervene.

You can then re-open phase 1 or start phase 2. Once you started phase 2, you can't back to phase 1 anymore.
