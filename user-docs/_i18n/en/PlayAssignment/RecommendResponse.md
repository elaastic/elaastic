Once added as a best response, it will be explicitly marked with a "solid star".
![Is recommended]({{"images/fr/play_assignment/recommended_responses/is_recommended.png"| relative_url }})

When you add responses as "best", they appear first in the list of responses.

All responses listed as "best" will be displayed on the main page, even if their number is greater than 3.
