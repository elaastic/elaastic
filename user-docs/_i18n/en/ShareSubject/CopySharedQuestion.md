## 5.4. Copy a shared question

We've seen in chapter 5.3. how to copy a shared subject. However, you can also copy a question of a subject only. To do so, the method is the same than when you work on you own resources. Click on the copy icon on the right of the question you wish to copy.

![Vue sur copy shared subject]({{ "../images/en/share_subject/button_copy.png"| relative_url }})
A popup appears and asks you to select the subject where you want to copy the question. Choose then confirm.

![Vue sur shared subject]({{ "../images/en/share_subject/choose_subject.png"| relative_url }})

A confirmation message appears to inform you that question has been successfully copied.

![Vue sur shared subject]({{ "../images/en/share_subject/message_copy.png"| relative_url }})

If you go the list of the questions of the subject where you copied the question, the latter appears. You can know edit it as you wish.

![Vue sur shared subject]({{ "../images/en/share_subject/questions_list.png"| relative_url }})
