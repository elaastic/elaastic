## 2.4. Assignments

An assignment is the instance of a subject for a designated audience (a class or a group of learners).
To run a subject, the teacher must create an assignment. In the example below,
the teacher has created 3 assignments in order to be able to use her "Equations" subject with 3 different audiences
(e.g. 3 different classes).
The teacher will be able to keep track of the different results he or she has obtained with the different audiences.
