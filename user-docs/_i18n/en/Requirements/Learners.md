## 6.2. For learners

Learners can participate in an elaastic [assignment]({% link KeyConcepts/Assignments.md %}) without having an account
on the platform. They then participate in the activity completely anonymously.

Learners can create an account on the platform using the [registration form](https://elaastic.irit.fr/elaastic-questions/register).
![Formulaire d'inscription Ã  la plateforme]({{ "../images/en/requirements/register_as-learner.png" | relative_url }})
When a learner participates in an assignment by being authenticated, then the teacher in charge of the assignment has the nominative
information about the learner.

In the case of using Elaastic via an online course platform such as Moodle, when a learner starts an elaastic assignment 
for the first time, then an account is created in elaastic automatically with information from that learner's Moodle account.  
In this configuration, the teacher can access to the nominative information about the participants of an
[assignment]({% link KeyConcepts/Assignments.md %}).
