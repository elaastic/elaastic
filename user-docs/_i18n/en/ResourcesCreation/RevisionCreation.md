## 3.5. Creating a revision

If the feature is enabled for your account, you can create revisions.
To do this, go to your subject management page and click on the "Assignments" tab.
Creating a revision works in the same way as creating an assignment.

1. Name the assignment (required).
2. Name your audience, i.e. the group of learners who will answer your questions.
3. Define the school year.
4. Add a description.
5. If you wish, anonymous users (via guest accounts) can participate in the assignment.
6. Set the revision access mode to define when the sequences will be made available to students for revision.
   1. "Not at all" does not authorize the use of the assignment for revisions; it is the equivalent of an ordinary assignment.
   2. "Only after supervised work" only authorizes a sequence to be transmitted to Konsolidation once you have performed the following action
      1. "Publish results" in a "face-to-face" context
      2. "End sequence" in "blended" and "distant" contexts
   3. "Immediately" transmits all sequences to Konsolidation as soon as the assignment is created

When you're finished, click on the green "Create" button.

Once you've done this, you're automatically redirected to the assignment tab of your topic's edit page. The assignment you've created now appears.
The revision tag reminds you of the settings you've made if you've authorized revisions, and doesn't appear if you've chosen the "Not at all" option.
