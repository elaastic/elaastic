/**
 * The phase of a sequence for a learner.
 * A phase has a type (RESPONSE, EVALUATION, RESULT) ; various implementation may be proposed for a type.
 * A phase has a specific position into its sequence denoted by 'index' (I think this info should be only hold by the sequence)
 * The active phase in a sequence is the one that the learner can fulfill (Note: this info should also by hold by the learner sequence).
 *
 * When it is active, a phase will be rendered into the player for a learner.
 * To do so, it has
 *  - a PhaseTemplate (its thymeleaf template)
 *  - a PhaseViewModel (the model that will be provided to the template)
 *  - a PhaseController that will expose the actions available to the learner (through the template)
 *  - a LearnerPhaseExecution : the data required to execute the phase (that will be loaded only when needed)
 *  - a LearnerPhaseExecutionLoader : the service that will interact with other application services to retrieve the LearnerPhaseExecution
